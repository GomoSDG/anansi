# Minesweeper 3.0
In this project I revisit my minesweeper implementations to explore data structures that can be better suited for implementing the game. The first two times we made use of Object Oriented Approaches that made use of recursive polymorphism to open blocks on the grid and to reveal neighboring blocks when a block is empty. We also randomly placed mines and number hints on the grid on initialisation. In this implementation, we are going to explore printing the number hints during gameplay making use of an algorithm inspired by Breadth First Search (BFS).

## Exploring the previous and current Data Strucures

## Getting Started

### Development Server
To start the development server you will need to run `npm run server` from your your command line. This will start a server on port `8020` on your local machine.
