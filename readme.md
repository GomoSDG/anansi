# Anansi
A graph based datastructure aims to model gridlike things. While exploring graph algorithms and datastructures, I realised that some well known games could be modelled using graph data structures. With Minesweeper and Tic Tac Toe in mind, I began a quest to figure out how well could these fit! In this repository you will find two things: the gridlike datastructure that I have now named Anansi (/əˈnɑːnsi/ ə-NAHN-see; literally translates to spider) after the Akan folktale character. This is because the grid resembles a spider's web. Secondly, you will find a number of games that I aim to model with Anansi.
